# Canvas Game Framework
A simple game framework based on SDL2 with support for pixel simulation

## Why is it called "Canvas"?
Because it's built to supports painting simulatable pixels to the screen. The pixels can then be used as play area (walls, ground, etc.) or gameplay elements (water, lava, etc.).

## Currently a WIP
